# Binary Search Trees
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Functionality

This is the [binary search tree (BST)](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/binary-search-trees) project, in which I create a balanced BST.

## Methods

| Method        | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| #build_tree     | Turns an array of data into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed |
| #insert     | Adds a new node containing a particular value      |
| #delete | Removes that new node, containing a particular line      |
| #find | Returns the node with the given value    |
| #inorder | Traverse the tree in 'inorder'    |
| #preorder    | Traverse the tree in 'preorder'
| #postorder | Traverse the tree in 'postorder'
| #height  | Accepts a node and returns its height
| #balanced? | Checks if the tree is balanced
| #rebalance | Balances an unbalanced tree

## Thoughts

This was a good one! By the end of it, I felt much better about recursion. It was also a good exercise in deciphering non-ruby programming languages, reading them like pseudocode, and expressing the logic in ruby. And binary search trees certainly made much more sense by the end of it.
